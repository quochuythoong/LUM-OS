# LUM-OS
This is my custom Linux-based OS called LUM OS or LUMOS.

# Purpose
The purpose of this project is for me to get familiar with Linux, kernel, shell, bash, script, ... all the related stuff that we can think of. 

# Remarks
I aim to create my own version of Linux-based OS to enhance my knowledge in embedded system as a fresh Electrical Electronic Engineer graduate.
